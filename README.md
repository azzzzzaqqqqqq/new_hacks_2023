The OpenSOS Emergency AI Agent is an automated system for emergency response. The project interacts with the caller, extracts important information,
provides a user-friendly interface for the human operator and outputs a suggested response. The system has the potential to be used by the government
for fast and accurate responses, thus improving the lives of the residents and contributing to the development of a smart city.
